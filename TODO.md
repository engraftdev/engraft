[x] ExtractTool pencil is broken
[ ] single-line values sometimes get shadowed, idk why
[ ] RequestTool: pagination (ex: for artic)
[ ] NotebookTool: cell name token renaming jumps around
    (and crashes: "Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'setStart' on 'Range': The offset 10 is larger than the node's length (9).")
[ ] keep needing to reload, ex: after picking example json
[ ] VoyagerTool: unstable reloads



[ ] @prev, @item etc don't work too good in deeply nested situations
    (provide hierarchy of shadowings?)
[ ] better key extraction? shouldn't I be able to autocomplete `item.id`, etc?
[ ] better MarkdownTool... maybe it's just a function?
[ ] get rid of "Output below input"
[ ] (optional) capping height of output? using shadowbox?
[ ] MDX as a nice way to stick react nodes into markdown
[ ] autofocus doesn't really work; rethink it
